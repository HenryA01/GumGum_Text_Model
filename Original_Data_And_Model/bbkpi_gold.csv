Which is a shame, because I think there are a lot of young designers in Berlin who have something interesting to present, but then there are Kirian Kerner and Marcel Ostertag.
Crop tops for men. That's the thing, right? Is that so? Or was it the thing last year? It's been the thing for a long time. I only get what Fabian Riesel presents on Instagram in terms of fashion. That's my only source of fashion. That seems to be his thing this year.
We won't be ranking Fabian Rehse's Fits. Unfortunately. Unfortunately, yes. We could do that. I'd like to do a T-shirt ranking with Fabian Rehse. I wonder which one he likes the most. Probably Hertha.
Yes, but good. It's a 97 shirt, which is also a very nice shirt. I'd rather talk about this shirt for half an hour than do what we're doing now. But I wanted to say that Felix needed me to participate in the shirt ranking. I'm looking forward to it. I'm looking forward to it. If I'm in a bad mood, I'll talk about every shirt, no matter how nice it is. I'm also looking forward to it. Of course, as a friendly editorial office, like every year,
Two jerseys were rated by every runner-up. In most cases, home and away. In some cases, home and away, because the away jersey was not yet presented at the time of the vote. And Kaiserslautern and Münster only presented one at the time of the vote, which is why only the home jersey can be rated. Angsthasen. Angsthasenfußball. Fear of our judgments. 34 jerseys were released.
Various people in the editorial team, I can tell you so much, from Tim Jürgens to social media manager Charlotte Hamel, interns, online editors, everyone. Everyone voted. A cross-section of society. It was a representative survey and a representative result.
Yes, totally. In the end, we got grades from 1 to 10 or points from 1 to 10. We also do it differently every year. No, we only did it differently at the European Championship. No, no, no. I would say that this voting has been going on for 10 years. I just clicked through the last few years. In principle, we have the second, first, European Championship in Trico Ranking. What do I know? It is simply according to personal taste of the respective organizer.
But it doesn't matter. Yes, that may be. I decided for 1 to 10 this year. No, that makes it a bit more differentiated. Exactly, I didn't want it to come out so often, but still at the end 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 even have the same average score. But we'll get to that in a moment. Because 10 is wow, high fashion, haute couture.
The most fantastic T-shirt ever. And one is... Neaples cotton bread. For example. Does that count? What do you mean? That's a remake. That doesn't count. But it's pretty high. What would be a 10 for you? Any T-shirt? The 97 Hatha T-shirt, for example.
But it depends on the kind of main sponsor. There are designs where the main sponsor is embroidered with a kind of primer. I don't like that. It depends. But for me it's probably a Barcelona jersey from the late 90s. Something very clean. For me the red jersey HSV 83, in which they also won the Europa Cup, or to name a current one,

Okay, I don't know it yet. What is it based on? On antiquity, probably. No, no. It's classic yellow. It's in gold. Not yellow, but striped in blue.
Very classic. Of course, everyone has ten quality Athens jerseys. No, I mean classic in the sense of a classic football jersey. Here, I'll show you. So, and here we are in the shop.

They immediately started pointing their fingers at every little minor problem on the Nadesco. Some people just like to condemn the shortcomings of others. No! Obviously, computers have the capacity to learn on their own. Accumulating knowledge from experience allows them to determine the best options. However, the Nadesco's computer... Yomikane. Oh, that's the name of the computer!
Attaching names to computers is an idiotic practice that ended in the 20th century. But it identifies itself as Omoikane. I don't care if it calls itself Orphan Annie. In any case, the Nadesco's computer remembers the experience of breaching the Earth's defense lines. Obviously, it now believes that the UEAF is its enemy. Which is why it targeted the UEAF armada as well as the Jovians.
So it's behaving like a disgruntled employee who resents new management after a hostile takeover by a competitor? That's a nice analogy, Miss Fassange. Believe me, I can sympathize with how it feels. And that kind of stress sometimes leads to destructive behavior. Normally, this stress would make a system lock up. If that were the case, we could simply cut the power, clear the RAM, and reset the entire system.
But Omoikane automatically resets itself anyway. And that is what we believe made the computer's resentment against the UEAF so strong. Rather than purging it, each reboot seems to have increased its paranoia until it felt compelled to attack. The only solution now seems to be a complete system rewrite. We'll have to wipe the memory completely. Could I say something, please? Yes.
Resorting to such draconian measures is stupid. To purge the computer's memory in such a fashion would mean a complete loss of all the valuable and still unanalyzed information it acquired during the Nadesco's mission to Mars. The Nadesco is operating as part of the UEAF. Any memories from when the ship was alone are more trouble than they're worth.
The Admiral is right. It's humans that fight to protect the Earth, not computers and machines. Reprogram that thing. And after that last fiasco, the ship will belong to the UAF. Therefore, it makes sense to have the system purged completely. We'll wipe the slate and start over. You're wrong, but it's what I expected. Why is it that adults think that forgetting something is a solution? You can't just throw knowledge away. Right, right.

We haven't, but we've run into each other at festivals and it just seemed a natural fit. At some point, it really becomes important to go out there and give everybody bang for buck. Give people something more than perhaps other bands are. We've had a history of going out there and trying to do the greatest shows possible.

That's crazy. Speaking of live shows, before we get into the album track by track, our band has our first festival coming up in two weeks. I wanted to know if you had any tips for a band playing their first festival. Make sure you're playing facing the audience. Oh, yeah. Don't face the amps. Don't face the amps. Yeah, no, that's a bad move. Yeah. Always make sure that you're plugged in.
I will be on. Well, you know what? I'm the bass player, so I don't even need to make sure that's up there with myself. And you know, yeah, do a lot. You know, do a little do some some lower lip biting. Yes. Yeah. And then aim it at him. Kiss style. Oh, yeah. That would be awesome. Yeah. Oh, no. Here. OK.
Here is a great bit of advice, and this is something that I've always done my whole career. Play that show like there's 20,000 people there, regardless of who's in front of you. Play that show big, because the bigger you feel, the bigger people are gonna be like, did you see that show? Did you see those guys? That's how you build a live audience. That's how you build a live fan base, is by showing them that it doesn't matter how many people are here. This is the show you're getting, because you're special.
Yeah. It's almost a fake it till you make it type of thing. It's not even fake because if you love what you do when you're on stage, whether it's 20 people, 200 people, 20,000 people, man, it's just all about entertaining those people because next time you come back, it's going to be exponentially bigger. So those 20 people will tell a hundred and then you've got 200 people there. Those 200 people tell and then you got a thousand and it just gets bigger and bigger and bigger.

All the outfits throughout the years? Do you have a warehouse somewhere with all the stuff? I've got, well, I have many closets in my house. It's stuffed full of crap that I'm sure my wife wishes I would get rid of. Certain closets, yeah, you open it, it's a jump scare. Exactly. Well, there's that. But, I mean, obviously, well, I mean, look at that one. That's definitely a jump scare. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, you know, between Slipknot and my house, you know, we have a lot of storage for some of this stuff. I actually pulled some of this stuff out of storage, so it's not actually at my house.
All of my crazy suits are there. Obviously my fake wrestler, fake muscle shirt is there. All of these looks you can Google. It's either film of me or pictures of me.
And it's, yeah, the Frankenstein with the blonde. That's the homage to the cover of Famous Monsters No. 1, which is a brand that I own. I bought that a couple years ago, so I'm relaunching that. So everything here...
relates to me in some way, especially this douche. Yeah, you got him on the back as well. Exactly. But that's kind of my homage to David Bowie. So the whole thing is kind of an homage to artists that I've never really paid tribute to, like the purple represents Prince. Oh, I love that. Yeah. Yeah. David. That look is my homage to David Bowie. And obviously the the setup is my homage to, you know, Sergeant Pepper. Love that. Absolutely. On the arm here. Exactly. One of the
one of the most iconic album covers. Well, I could say that, or I could also say, uh, we're in it for the money. Yeah. Which is Frank Zappa, which I also love. Yeah. That's awesome. I love it. So the box opens it up. Big cinematic opening. You're playing the mandolin on this. I assume. Yeah. It was the first thing I wrote on mandolin and I just bought it and I was sitting in, I was sitting on the bus and we were on a tour with, uh, for, we are not your kind.
And I was sitting on the bus, just kind of tinkering around, and I started kind of playing around with the chord progression, and I was like, this is awesome. I really love this. And the intro started to kind of formulate in my head, and that really kind of set the tone.
for what I wanted this album to be. It's like that was gonna be the doorway, you know, that was gonna be the curtains kind of pulling back on the stage. And then the show is the set, you know, the show is the songs in this order, you know. So it felt really cool to kind of have that eureka moment while I was sitting there just kind of playing this mandolin. And I was like, this is gonna be special. I have it in my notes. Enjoy the show. Like what a great setup for the entire album. Was this written to be the opener? Did you know it as you're writing it? Like, oh, it sounds like the intro.
when I'm when I'm working on something and I kind of have the idea that that's gonna be the intro that definitely sets the tone so working on it and when we were recording it I knew sonically this was gonna be the way not only that the album was gonna open up but we also use that as our intro for the show so when you come and see us play not only do you hear the box as the intro but then we come out and we play post-traumatic blues live yeah and it's just the perfect one-two punch it's
Which that one kicks off the chaos, like the drums kick in, the crazy guitar solo, there's such a great bass tone on it. Are you very particular about guitar tones, bass tones, drum sounds when you're making an album? I mean, there's definitely vibes that you try to lean into when it comes to
whether it's heavy stuff or just rock stuff or punk stuff or the acoustic stuff, the stuff that has that kind of classic singer-songwriter vibe to it. But it's almost like golf clubs, man. You reach in your bag and you find the one that really fits. And my band is so good that we know how to dial stuff right away. And because we were playing everything live in the studio, we knew that we would go, okay, let's try the 5150 with that. I'm gonna go with my Orange for this one.
Or if you were doing something like Breath of Fresh Smoke, which I actually played my Les Paul Custom on, that was the guitar that I wrote it on. And I ran that through a Wizard 800.
With a with a good like a night like a nasty boost right and that just gave it that really great Almost like a gin blossoms feel you know like yeah Yeah, so you're so you're constantly looking for the flavors musically you know to crunch to stack this stuff
And my band is so good that if I throw an idea at them, like a vibe, they immediately know how to do it. Or Jay Rustin, my production partner, knows how to do it as well. So each song kind of has its own soul, you know, and being able to kind of dial that tone up quickly, it makes everything so much easier that you can just run with it.
And over the years, a song like this, does it get easier or harder to record in the studio? Easier vocally. I mean, well, if you're still into it, yeah, it makes it so easy, man. It's the stuff that you're not into, which is a slug. It's a slag. It's, it's, it's like, it's like trying to walk around with an anchor, you know, try running a five K pulling a boat. You know what I mean? That's what it feels like.
But if you're still into making music and into the whole spirit of creation and stuff like that, it shouldn't be hard. It should be easy because you want to do it. So to me, the exciting part, even if it takes a second to kind of get everything together,
The exciting part is watching it come together. That's the fulfillment of everything that you've been thinking about, because I obsess about this stuff. I'm such a big Beatles fan. Get Back, when you're watching Paul strum along and watch that come out of him. It's such a fascinating vibe, because I've done that a million times with my songs, where you're just sitting",False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

At least we had a life before it. Thank God we had a life. How old are you? I'm 36. I'm 37, so yeah. I call us the greatest generation.
Fuck the World War II vets. Yeah, you killed a few Nazis. Big fucking deal. I always say that we are, and I apologize for my long time listeners because I say this all the time, but this is like, I believe the pillar of my existence here on this world is like, we are
old enough to know a life before it. Where you didn't have porn and entertainment and social, like friendships, all that at your fingertips. So we, you know, we work for it a little bit. We know that life without it, but we are, we're also not like morons when it comes to technology, like our parents are. We did pick up the internet. We did adapt. Maybe we can't do TikTok.
and Snapchat, but we're savvy enough, while also remembering a time without it, because kids now are like, spoiled, and they don't even realize it, and a little bit before us is like, you're dinosaurs, you got eaten by the internet, and then we are here, and we are the ones who like, we proliferated the internet, we like, we grew it, you know, we're the greatest.
We are the most, we are like the missing link of technology. Yes, it is a valuable tool to be able to kind of toggle back and forth, go remember that and then look at it now. But I think just like with, I'm gonna try to get this right, you know people who invented the iPad and the iPhone, they played outside as kids. Yes. So you got to remember they didn't have that and they still invented it. And I think eventually, how old are you?
25, okay. She's a pup. These are pups. This kid's 22? 20. 21. 22.
Okay, okay, anyone else hard? But no, so I think with you guys, maybe the generation after you, because you guys are already deep in the pool, but the generation after is gonna go the other way and go, fuck technology, we're reading books, we're going out to the woods, we're gonna cook on a fire and all that shit and have conversations and stories and all that and turn the phones away because everything kind of flippy floppies and it's gonna go the other way, I think.
Well, you know what's interesting though, and maybe this is just me rationalizing it or defending my disgusting phone usage, but I believe the most important thing in life is interaction with other people. I don't think it's like, you know, reading a book, great, but I think I'd rather have a conversation with someone.
I'd rather interact with someone, meet people, learn new things that way. And the internet is amazing for that. And you gotta weed people out, you're gonna meet a bunch of assholes, but the amount of guests I've gotten to have on my show that I've met, the amount of people that I've just, I have internet friends who are important people in my life now. The stuff you read, the people you interact with,
That, I think, has made me into a more well-rounded person, more educated, more cultured, experienced. So I don't think of it as a bad thing that I'm on the phone interacting with you straight. It's weird, but I think it's good. Ultimately, I think good. I think it's ultimately good too, but just like everything else, a gun is good because it protects your family, but then you start shooting cans and then you shoot your sister in the eye.
So everything's got, it's like fire. Fire has kept us alive, you know, with cooking food and keeping us warm, but then it also burns your granny's house down when she's smoking grass. So it's all over the place. My grandma used to bootleg cigarettes off the Indian reservation. Really? She used to get Kent cigarettes by the fucking box because they were tax free or whatever like that. Hell yeah. She loved them. She had a kinship with the Native Americans because of that. How about that?
Killed her, you know, put her in her grave, but- Did they? I mean, well, on the cigarettes. Oh, I thought they scalped her. Holy shit, you scared me there. I should have just gone with that one. Yeah, no, absolutely. Tore her skin off, bone, you know, chopped her in half, bone tomahawk style. Right, right. But yeah, I think the internet to me also is like, like if you could
snap your fingers, and just be one of these people who's ignorant, not in a negative way. Ignorance is bliss. They are just completely peaceful with their home, and their wife, and their kids, and they're nine to five. That'd be great.
I sound condescending when I say it. I don't mean that you're not ambitious, but you're not, you're just like, I am what I am. I don't need to really strive to be more than that. Because I think that's where the internet comes into play, too. When you were, a couple generations ago, you have access to the people in your town, and that's really it. You marry the girl who's pretty enough, the guy who's good enough, you have the kids, you have the house that's decent, you work in the few jobs that are available, and that's that.
And you're just happy. And that's your calling card, by the way, huh? The burp.

I think they're a very competitive team this year. I think they have a good defense. If they're going to win a game against a major program, this is it.
Wait so Frank give us a ranking of your teams because I was actually talking to Shane about this because he was wondering like if it's gonna be I said it's not Mets Frank it's a little different for Notre Dame because I know Seton Hall Frank is like the most I've told this story before but Frank came in from the Big East tournament and Seton Hall had lost and I was like gotta get rid of the coach and Frank was like
I know you got to give him more time. He's building something here. I was like, who the fuck am I talking to right now? Well, it was his first year. Yeah, I know you're, you're reasonable with Seton Hall. So what are the rankings of your sports teams? Probably Mets, Devils, Dolphins are probably like 2A, 2B. Okay. And then? I guess Notre Dame would slip in there, maybe around number four. Okay. Knicks are kind of new, so I guess they're kind of like,
Just behind Seton Hall. Okay. Okay. All right. That's good ranking. So the the Notre Dame fandom, you won't like lose it if they lose. No, I don't. Right.

It does feel like you're taking Tommy Pham's thoughts way too highly. Frank, you hated Tommy Pham when he played for the Mets. But I've watched the team, and I know what he said is true. I watched Daniel Vogelbeck hit a ball that rolled to the wall. Rolled to the wall, and it took him 18.9 seconds to get to second base, and he was still out by 10 feet.
That's a long time. It's tough. It is tough. I've seen Dango Vogelback thrown out at second twice this year on singles to the center fielder. Was that 18.9 seconds both times?

He's returning to this film after a brief hiatus, having spent the fall of the previous year filming three sequences, the finale, it turns out, of the film.
Lee performs the work and assumes the responsibility of eight people in the creation of this film. He's the director, the producer, the choreographer, the author of the screenplay, in addition to having a hand in set design, the cinematography, and the lighting of the film. And of course, he's the leading actor.
Martial artists who are not accustomed to the camera must be taught how to sell a strike or a reaction for optimal dramatic effect. Again, this falls to Lee to look after. Take after take of precision martial art choreography is performed. Lee will spend in some instances up to four days filming what will turn out to be only a five-minute fight sequence. Lee is most demanding of himself.
In this shot, involving his handling a nunchaku, an ancient Oriental weapon that was originally used as a rice flail, Lee will shoot no less than 10 takes to capture one small sequence that will appear on screen for a mere 3.5 seconds.

And he just was like, okay, you gave me the truth, so I'll play for your team.
Yeah, it's not going to work. It's not going to hurt anybody. We're just trying to make money. Yeah. Then he was like, I don't know about the other guys.

To get him to play on his team. I think Woody Johnson's completely separated from any of the R&D and actual runnings of the Johnson & Johnson company. I think he's on the board. Is he on the board? He was also he was an ambassador to Ireland. I think that means he's boozing, dude. He literally is like the ambassador to booze. That would be the best ambassadorship, I think. Well, maybe maybe some like Ireland, maybe Antigua.
That'd be nice too. But yeah, going to Ireland on a diplomatic, it's actually probably easier. You just go over there. Like what, what public relations or what, uh, what behind the scenes international relation strain do we ever have with the Irish? Well, the IRA was a problem. We were giving them too many guns that that could have been tricky a long time ago though. When was he, let's see when he was, I think 2016. Okay. Yeah. So yeah, he's during the fun times. Yeah.

If you've seen McGregor, like, within, like, three months ago, he was, like, jacked the gills, dude's head's grown, like, two hat sizes. What does that come from? What does that mean, jacked to the gills? What does that mean? Well, I think it comes from wet to the gills, which means, like, drunk, but, like, jacked to the gills, which is just, like, pumped up.
Let's look that up. That's a good word. A really strong fish. That's what they... What did bodybuilders have gills? I don't understand this, where it comes from. To the greatest degree possible. Okay, entirely or extremely to the gills. But where's the origin? To the gills origin. It's a good question.
It comes from the phrase stuffed to the gills, which means so full you can't eat anymore. That seems to have come from the fact that when you stuff a fish for cooking, you fill it all the way to the gills. Okay. That makes sense. Yeah. Look at us learning of that. So we got anything else we want to get into before we discuss the dead internet theory? I have been attacking my new year's goals.
And I got back into piano lessons, and I had my first one, and it's a dude who's hilarious. He's very ... He's not into anything pop culture. You can tell he's just the type to sit in his house and listen to classical music and drink tea. That's the type of nigga this nigga is.
I go to his, I thought I was going to like a studio. I ended up going to his house, but it's like a dude who runs a studio and he divvies out to people's houses, whatever. It ends up being like nine minutes from where I stay. Super cool cat. I walk in and you kind of talk about like my goals, like what I want to do. He wants to teach me to read music, you know, and we started on a lesson.
And I told him, I kind of want to learn how to build chord structure, kind of on the spot by my own, be able to play live seamlessly with people, stuff like that. He's like, yeah, we can get all that done. He's like, what kind of music do you do? I was like, I put out some hip hop projects. He's like, oh, OK. He's like, I'm not really into it. He's like, I know it. I like how they sample. He'd be talking to me like that. Anyway, we'd go through the whole lesson.
At the end, he was like, would you like me to play anything? I was like, yeah, man, let me see you get busy. So he pulls out his sheet music and he's going in on some piece from the 1300s or some shit, going in. And he hits two or three chords and I was like, ooh. It was just beautiful, right? And he turns back and says, you can put that into hip hop.
Super cool moment, man. I'm excited to build with dude, but it was funny as hell. That's cool. So you're playing the piano. You used to play before, right? Well, I can play, right? So like, you know, I can play.
If I know the chords, I learn the chords, I get it, I'm fine. But I want to be able to read music, one. Two, I want to be able to jam with a band. There's nothing better than jamming with a band and talking in the musical language. Like, okay, we're Kiwi-ing and you're dancing and you're going and there's modulations and you're just talking and you know where you're about to go with it. That's what I want to do. That shit is one of the goals of my life. So I got to start from square one and understanding theory in a real way.
it's going to be a long journey. But he was like super, not to brag, but he was like, yo, you have talent, you know, for not really knowing anything. He's like, I think if you, if you do this, you can, you can do this. If you apply yourself. I have a small tip for you. You should pretend to be blind. Get some sunglasses. Helps with marketing. Yeah. Blind Arian Foster. I'm missing a certain Genesee qua.

He got fired from CNN for saying, from the river to the sea, unjustly by the way. But I think he's just a brilliant brother who's very knowledgeable about that subject in particular, but also black history. He's just a very knowledgeable brother that I admire.
So he's the one where I really started learning a lot of critical race theory from and kind of pointed me to what books to read about it and stuff. Because there's people saying, oh, the teaching is in K-12. And he was like, where, what, what curriculum? And he was arguing with right-wing pundits about that specific issue. And that's what he went to school for. And he's very in-depth and knowledgeable about that.

380913ba-ce25-524b-93d2-eea14676ce56_3.mp4,"would kind of be our definition of both these teams moving forward. Like if Clemson is able to beat Ole Miss and Lane Kiffin, who's been the portal king more or less the last couple of seasons. You say, well, I guess Dabo Sweeney's way works. Maybe Dabo Sweeney and his whole deal with we're gonna build it internally, we're gonna recruit our guys and just kind of develop them from there. Maybe there is more salt to that than we have maybe given him credit for over the course of the last couple of seasons.
But if Ole Miss wins, you say, okay, well now you can portal your way to the tier one of the college football world. And honestly, I think it would reflect even more poorly on Clemson saying, you got passed by a team who has leaned on the portal because you have chosen to not use the portal. So there would be a lot of talking points coming out of that game based on the result.
The juice from that one would be, no pun intended for Lane Kiffin's dog, the juice from that one would be exceptional. Now here's one more for you. Alabama at Florida State. Think back to last year's Selection Sunday. And y'all already know where I'm going with this. Florida State, undefeated, ACC champion, assuming they've done everything they need to to get into the college football playoff. Alabama just beat Georgia the night before. And we were in Atlanta and I was,
Feeling perplexed going into that game, or going into, excuse me, that selection Sunday coming out of that game, because I had just seen Alabama, with my own two eyes, beat who I believe was the best team in college football in Georgia. And I'm like, listen, man, I don't know how you draw it up, I don't know how it makes sense on paper, but Alabama's one of the best four teams. At the same time, you're like, well, Florida State, man, they've done everything they can. They've done everything they've been asked to do when it comes to qualifying for that college football playoff. So what do you do?
Florida State, man, they still have a bitter taste in their mouth for missing the college football playoff. They still feel some type of way, and they should. I would if I were a part of that team. I'm not commenting on what was right or what was wrong. We've already done that a fair amount. But I think if you get this game, you're able to at least have some sort of closure on last year's issue.
Now if Kalen DeBoer makes the college football playoff with Alabama year one, I think you already checked the box for yourself and say, okay, great. Optics are stable. Alabama is going to continue to be Alabama. Kalen DeBoer is going to be fine. If Florida State makes the college football playoff, similarly, you're saying Mike Novell is that guy.
Mike Norvell has been that guy, but to do it with the 83rd returning production unit in the country, out of 134 teams, with all that you lost last year, and you just boss up and keep the main thing, the main thing, keep it moving forward, like, obviously, that would do a lot to have no hitch. It would be tremendous for Mike Norvell, okay? But this game itself, be personal. It would be very, very personal. And I said this before, but if we got Alabama at Florida State, like this game is played in Tallahassee,
that place would be, I mean, that place would be going to the moon. I mean, it would be one of those atmospheres that I think you could probably only try and describe if you had been there, because your broadcast copy, your camera, your sky cam, whatever, it would all, I mean, it would be vibrating, it'd be shaking.
I would love to see that game. I get that it's not last year's squad at Alabama. It's not the same pound for pound operation at Florida State either, but just to have those two fan bases going at each other leading into the college football playoff would be a thing of beauty.
So those to me are very, very, very real potential college football playoff hypotheticals. We actually have both Georgia and Oregon and Alabama at Florida State meeting up in the college football playoff. So no matter how you slice it, man, playoff hypotheticals, I don't think it's ever too early for us to just take a peek at what that could look like. And a college football season again, it's here.

They took two lanterns with them. Those lanterns were a signal to the Sons of Liberty in Charlestown. It signified that British troops would be marching that night to Lexington and Concord, taking the shorter route by rowing across the Charles River to Cambridge.
The lanterns were held aloft for about a minute. Dozens of riders were sent out from Charlestown immediately. The most famous of the riders, Paul Revere, made it out to Lexington that night to deliver a warning to Sam Adams and John Hancock that the British were marching to capture them.
The story about the hanging of the lanterns was not nationally known until 1860. That's when Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, a local poet, friend of the abolitionist cause, wrote the poem Paul Revere's Ride.
Longfellow was using the symbol of Paul Revere streaking across the countryside to encourage young men to join the Union Army to save their nation and to free slaves in the American South. He used the image of two lights streaming from a church steeple.
to assert that God had blessed the American cause of freedom, both freeing ourselves from the British and the Revolutionary War, but also freeing slaves in the American South in the Civil War that would begin just a few months after the poem was published.

Brewers are one of the best teams in National League. And they're minus 105. What does that tell you? Okay, that does, that does, that is a little sexy. Who we got on the bump? Jake Irvin for the Nats. And Frankie Montes for the Brewers. First start for them? No, no, he's been there a minute. Did he get traded? No. What am I thinking? Not a baseball guy. Yeah, neither am I. So I'm just looking at that one just to see. Alright, okay. Yeah, go ahead. I have a play I really, really like. You don't have to say that every goddamn day. I like it.
Everybody knows this guy. Tremont waters. Is that a school? No, he's a five 11 guard for Puerto Rico. Where Puerto Rico under 14 and a half points.
He's playing the US. This line makes no sense to me. So it is very difficult to actually get box scores for Olympic basketball. Like you have to go on the Olympic site. They don't list it very well. So I've compiled a sheet where I'm tracking everyone's points, rebounds, assists, three pointers, et cetera. This line is crazy. He's had, I think they've played six games or five games. He's had double digit points once. He had 18 points once.
Now, I'm guessing this is because Jose Alvarado tweaked his ankle a couple days ago, and they're thinking Tremont Waters is just gonna go off. He had nine points last game. I know they got blown out. 14 and a half points is way too much. He doesn't shoot the ball that much. He's gonna shoot a lot of threes, so I guess, like, all right, maybe he's gonna get super hot from three, but he just has not shot the ball a lot. This line is way too high. This line should be, like,
11 and a half, 10 and a half, maybe at best. Puerto Rico is going to get blown out tomorrow. They're going to be eliminated from the tournaments. They're going to play their guys the whole way and try and go balls to the wall. But this line is very stinky to me. And I'm going to take the under on this. This, it stinks. And also just keep in mind, Olympic basketball, like all the sets are way lower than NBA, shorter game, et cetera. Like guys don't play as much. It's a rarity for a guy to play 30 minutes.

Edgar Cayce grew up in Hopkinsville, Kentucky in the late 1800s. He worked the farm, then various low-level jobs in his youth and a young adulthood. He was a devout and practicing Christian. He even read the entire Bible every year and prayed at the beginning of every one of his channeling sessions.
In fact, his faith meant that he was shocked when information about reincarnation was revealed to him, taking years to accept it as true. So how did that young boy become a prolific spiritual healer and full-time medium who founded multiple institutes?

The main reason that my control research is being mentioned
is because people are alleging that they were exposed as children to mind control, radiation, drugs, and chemical experimentation, which were administered by the same doctors who are known to have been involved in conducting both radiation and mind control research. Written documentation has been provided revealing the names of people and the names of research projects in statements from people across the country. It is also important to understand that mind control techniques
and follow-ups into adulthood may have been used to intimidate these particular research subjects into not talking about their victimization in government research. People talk about MKUltra in two senses. It's kind of like the umbrella term for all mind control programs. But technically, it's just a specific program that ran from the 50s into the 60s.

As king, he attended to affairs of state, and as husband and father, stayed at Windsor Castle with the Queen and their young children, Mary, Edward and Albert.
Later, the king invested his son Edward with the hereditary title of Prince of Wales. As the heir apparent received the crown, a new phase of history opened and the king with affection and pride presented his son to his people.

Household name. Everyone knows who you are. Yes, everyone. Agreed. You had to have done something different than everybody else. Agreed.
You had to have been on the forefront of something. You're some sort of pioneer, whether in your field. What about awards? So say they're an actress or a singer, would you say they would have to have an award, like a Grammy or an Oscar? I would say having those awards makes you stand out a little bit more. I mean, it just makes you more popular. It makes you more of a household name. So usually they go hand in hand.
You gotta be cool. Gotta be cool. Yeah, you can't just be good at what you do, you also have to be an all-around iconic person. Right, because there's a lot of people that are good at what they do, but you're like, they're not an icon. No personality. You know who I think is a good example of that? I don't know why it just came to my mind. Bon Iver, I think, is an excellent musician, but he's kind of a weirdo. I don't think he'll ever be considered an icon, but he did change that.
Genre of music like he is a pioneer in that way, but people don't really talk about it cuz he's very private He kind of a sad boy, you know, I'm thinking fashion I'm thinking of like a rapper who's like a great rapper, but I'm not gonna call him an icon Jay-z. No Jay-z's an icon Jay-z's and
Well, Dickie is not an icon. He's not there yet. He's not an icon. What about Drake? You think Drake is an icon? Drake's an icon. I think he's an icon. Drake is absolutely an icon.

Who the fuck knows?
I feel like he gave them permission, then forgot about it, and was like, they released it without me. You know who's an absolute icon of all sorts? Obviously, Britney Spears, that just popped in my head. Miley Cyrus. Because not only Miley Cyrus, Hannah Montana. She has two iconic names. Can you name somebody else that's got the dual, Miley Cyrus and Hannah Montana? You know who's similar to me in that way? Darius Rucker. You think he's a country star on his own, and he's Hootie and the Blowfish.
Not on the level of Miley Cyrus and Hannah Montana. She skews younger, I think. But iconic. But people know Miley Cyrus. Everyone knows Miley Cyrus. Everyone knows Hannah Montana. You don't think everybody knows Darius Rucker?
I'm just thinking people with to who does who to who've done like to I mean, yeah I mean you could probably put them together. I just don't know enough He's not as iconic as Miley Cyrus. I think he though has his own icon in his world. Yeah I don't know if anybody else has a double life like that. I think hmm
Wait, remember, would you guys say Houdini's an icon? Remember Houdini? Oh, certainly. Remember Houdini. Houdini. Daddy Houdini, we remember him. Yeah, he's an icon. He's definitely an icon. I think that, what about old timey stars like Lucille Ball, like I Love Lucy. Would you briefly think that she's an icon? I know that name. You know that name, yeah.

Who's the handsome man? We're just naming the most famous people. Yeah, Marilyn Monroe. Who's the handsome man? What about Stevie Nicks? Fleetwood Mac. But also solo career. Yes, yes, that's a good one. That's a good double. And she's way bigger. Well, she's a witch, so she's got the witch community behind her. Stevie Nicks, Icon. She's unbelievable.

No, that's a great, great description. That blew me away, holy shit. You're so right about that. That's the only one I could think double named. I want to talk about Beyonce too for a second. Do you think that Beyonce is on the level of icon where she can just like literally do anything and people will be like, yes, Beyonce. I think yes, definitely. I think her and Kanye are the same way. I think so too. Oh yeah.
whatever they release. She's like, I love Beyonce. I want a record. I love Beyonce. I do not want the Beyhive coming after me. I am a huge fan. Lemonade changed my life. You are a huge Beyonce fan. Lemonade is everything to me. I think that she is like, I think most artists are like a little full of themselves in a way that it's like comes, you know, they're very confident. They're,
Kanye's like borderline narcissistic Beyonce's kind of the same but she does it in like a in like a veiled way that we don't think we wouldn't call her a Narcissist I wouldn't be like Beyonce's a narcissist.

Wow. Minus 400 on the money line and they gave you a draw. I saw something. So I did see the Carly Lloyd, the Carly Lloyd clip. Apparently they drew yesterday with Portugal and they're like.

Oh, they have to make a move. They have to make a move. They need a left fielder, something that puts Schwarber at pure DH. Who's available? There's no outfielders available. I mean, Tommy Finn. Tyler O'Neal's available, and also Tescar Hernandez has been thrown out there. I would like either of those. I think they fit in the lineup very nice. I would like to see them also get a starting pitcher, bump Sanchez to the bullpen. And if they can get one more bullpen arm, it'd be great. But they're going to do something. Dabrowski doesn't sit on his hands.
He finds a way. And there's a big series with the Marlins. I don't know if O'Neal is an option. It sounds like Dylan Carlson might be the guy the Cardinals are willing to move more than O'Neal.
I don't hate Thomas Carlson. I love the switch-hitting prospect. He was huge in the Cardinals organization coming up. I mean, he obviously fell out of favor. And a couple of Cardinals we're throwing out there. I can't pronounce his name. Galilagos, wherever his name is. I would like him. I would also like Flaherty, if the Phillies can somehow get him.
It's at the point, after the past, I think, three years, Dombrowski's been here. I trust him, no matter what. Guy has an eye. He's got a fucking eye for talent. He's incredible. I mean, you know. It's just a matter of what they, it's a matter of what they give up. He's won a World Series with the Marlins, right? He built the Expos up in the early 90s. Won a World Series with the Marlins. Went to a World Series with the Tigers. Wins a World Series with the Red Sox. Goes to a World Series with the Phillies. I mean, his resume is Hall of Fame worthy.

So if you come out of this, this isn't Detroit at 601, you come out of this, you don't, there's no moves made. You're going to be, are you going to be like Ebo and be like, eh, or are you going to actually be back?
It depends what was out there that they, what out there that's reported, what they can give up. Like if you're asking to give up, you know, Andrew Painter and Mick Abel and Griff McGarry, like three of their top 20 prospects for Dylan Carlson or Flaherty, I'd be like, that might be a little too much. But if you can scrounge something together for them, like that, that's fine.
I think they need to make a move for the playoffs, especially depth-wise. But if it doesn't happen, I still have confidence in them at least getting to the playoffs and making it. It's just Schwerber and left field. They got this guy, I don't know if you know, Johan Rojas, who's a rookie. They just brought him up. He's been electric in the field. I saw him make a great play when I went to a game in Philadelphia. He made an insane play.
Yeah, I, I don't know how they're going to be getting him in the mix. Christian Pache has had a great year with healthy. He's coming back soon. So I don't know how they're going to get him in the mix too, but we'll see. But Harper playing first base opens up a lot of possibilities for them. And also Reese Hoskins is making moves to come back as a DH for the playoffs. I don't know if that's going to happen, but I'd be sick. Apparently he's forced to hit when the players do that.
the cops. No, I hate when I love when they do it actually, but I hate when they're like, Oh, he could be back. And then they just, Oh, we'll be back for the world series. Now it's like, all right, well we wanted to, you know what I mean? Like I, I, cause then you get the fans excited. Like, especially when it's retosking or somebody like that when Schwab is cool. Yeah. It's a, it's a nine to 12 month injury. So, Oh yeah. It's crazy that he's even thinking of coming back. Um, do you think Goldschmidt goes anywhere?
I don't know. That's a great question because, you know, Arenado signed for about three or four more years. Goldsman's only signed through the end of next year. There are not a lot of, you know, you heard Smitty talk, there's not a lot of great hitting options out there. Like when Teoscar Hernandez is one of the best guys, that's a pretty weak field. So Goldsman would get a lion's share if you trade him. So I think they should trade him. Will they? I don't know.
Yeah. Um, I, again, I wanted to, I, I, yesterday I made a small comment of Joe Burrow maybe being a little overrated and I wanted to make sure I said that in front of your face because I saw a stat of Kirk Cousins playoffs and Joe Burrow's playoffs numbers. Obviously Joe Burrow's had a little less, you know, actually these numbers have been brought to me. I think, I think, uh, I heard Brandon dumb ass trying to do this last year.
I'm a Joe Burrow fan. I'm not a fan of his new hair. His new hair has made him look worse.
One one point seven five touchdowns per game is is Kirk Cousins. One point four playoffs. One point four for Joe Burrow. Both same turnovers per game like a half same pass pass rate ninety six point five for four cousins ninety three point eight for Joe Burrow.
both same amount of yards per game 20 points scored for 20 points and 22 same thing and then it was 28 points allowed for the vikings and then 18 points allowed for the for the bangles so basically this stat is saying that the defense did carry him most of the time
Um, I would like to see so that the two glaring things I'd like to see what I would point out would be one. Obviously, the sample size would be smaller bars and same. He's only really a few playoff runs. The first one they had the like the one where they made they actually didn't make the Super Bowl. They had like the worst offensive line ever. But you remember that Tennessee game where they got sacked nine times in a game. They were horrific offensive lines. The other one I would bring up, which I think is a key sense being left out is how many points their offense have scored.
Because think about how many times, like, a quarterback drives a guy down the field, hand off, like, a one-yard touchdown, and then by those stats would get no credit. So I'd be curious to see how many points. The defense is fair, but I'd like to see how many points the offense scored. Like, if Burroughs' offense is averaging, like, 30, 25, 30 a game, and then Cousins averaging, like, 17 to 20, I think that'd be, like, a clear, which I don't know if that's the case. I'd just be curious to see those numbers. What are we doing here? Joe Burroughs has 9,000 yards, two years combined.
69 touchdowns. I know we're dumbing down the Kirk Cousins slander after quarterback and his button-up shirts, but let's be honest here. Is Kirk Cousins ever making a Super Bowl? Not just winning. Is Kirk Cousins ever making one?
probably nice too yeah and the window is so much shorter now he's gonna get what he this is his last year on his deal that's i'm very curious to see what the vikings obviously is going to depend on what happens this season a lot but i'm very curious what the vikings do he's a lame duck after this year i'll be uh yeah like he'll have to hold",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,True,False,False

So here we are in Doris Duke's bedroom here at Rough Point. This one has one of the more royalistic feelings of the rest of the house. We're told generally Rough Point feels very homey, like someone's actual house, and that's because it was lived in. This room is actually filled with pieces made for royalty. This is also probably the largest amount of mother-of-pearl furniture anyone will see in one place in their entire lifetime. All of this was made in the 1800s for Spanish royalty in Austria.
Doris was very much into eclectic mixing and matching when it came to her art collecting. So, for example, the furniture in here, for the most part, is Austrian, all these mother-of-pearl pieces. We also have a French painting above the fireplace. You may recognize the artist's name. That's an Auguste Renoir from 1875.

The US sends its most competitive and youngest challengers in decades.

Vladimir Kramnik, the wildcard, was once known for his incredibly solid playing style. He popularized one of the main weapons of elite chess players, the Berlin Wall.

A man named Ludlow and a countryman of mine named Lem Howe. I suppose you saw them. Lem was Mr. Wentworth's personal servant. Ludlow is discharged chauffeur. Meaning nothing. You say he was discharged? Yes, sir. He came to plead for his job back. What time was that? Early in the day, sir. Shall we go, Sweet?
Thank you very much, Jackie. See Wong, they're trying to clear that kid. I'll make you eat your hat yet. Found him on the fire escape, Chief. Yeah, who are you? Chief of Police. Why, he's the Wentworth chauffeur. What were you doing on the fire escape? Parking my car.
Hard to get along with, huh? No, I just don't get chummy with strangers. So? Ever seen one of those? Seen a lot of them, haven't you? Don't like cops at all. You better start talking or I'll lock you up. What for? Prowling. Then why were you discharged? Oh, I was a bad, bad boy. I got drunk. And when was that? A month ago. Are you looking for trouble? No.
I'm just trying to find some clue to help the Fleming boy. What's your interest in him? I miss Cynthia's show for now. Aced yourself right back in again, huh? All right, you can go. But don't leave town. Talum. Tough customer, that one. I never did like him. I wish Cynthia hadn't hired him.
I'm going to make her farm. Oh, why don't you mind your own business? You're always butting into things that don't concern you. You sure can send a lot of work talk. The talk is big enough. Can I drop you anyplace warm? Oh, I know where you can drop me. Yeah, so do I on your head. Oh, I know, Flemming. It's gone.
I'm very glad to meet you, Mr. Wong. Won't you sit down? Thank you. Cynthia told me you were on the case. A very curious case, Mr. Martin. Dick is incapable of committing murder. I quite agree with you. Is there anybody else that you suspect? I know of no one to suspect. I wish I did for Dick's sake. You were very close to Mr. Wentworth, weren't you? Closer than anyone. He gave me my start. I owe him whatever success I've had. You saw him shortly before his death, didn't you? Within the very hour.
Was anything said at that time that might help us? No. Matter of his insurance policies on the... ...ill-fated ship. But I believe they're going to be paid. They have. He's been completely exonerated. And he obviously wasn't worrying about that. He had been under a strain ever since the disaster. In fact, I was afraid that he contemplated doing away with himself. Really?
Why? Because I just made out a new will, which he signed then, seeming anxious to get it over with. Suicide? Might be, but then there's the matter of the gun. He could hardly dispose of that if he had a bullet in his heart. Might not someone else have taken it to conceal that it was suicide? I see what you mean. The boy, for instance. Perhaps thinking of the girl? Heavens, no.
Put himself on a spot? I doubt if any man is capable of that much chivalry. It's true, isn't it, that the company was in rather low water, even before the Wentworth Castle was burned. I thought no one outside knew that. Well, I gathered that from the stock market quotations. Conditions are not entirely due to the times. In fact, large sums of money have been disappearing from the company funds. Oh.
And who knew that besides you and Mr. Wentworth? Matthews. He had access to the funds? Yes, but he's been tireless in his efforts to stop the leak. Hmm. I can quite understand that. I'm reluctant to believe Matthews was in the same room with Fleming when the shot occurred. But Fleming may have turned his back just for the moment that it took to open the door and fire the shot. With Matthews in the same room? If you'll send for your secretary, I'll give you a demonstration. Why, certainly.
Yes, sir. Miss Wilson, this is Mr. Wong. How do you do? How do you do? If you'll sit down, please. If you don't mind, I'm going to try a little experiment with these two coins. Now, it's not going to hurt you. Now, just close your eyes, and I'll snap these two coins. In front of your head, behind your head, and over your head. And you tell me where the sound comes from. All right. Are your eyes closed?
In back of my head. In front. Still in front. Thank you very much. Well, was I right? Not once. Was there something wrong with me? Well, oddly.
That certainly is one for the book. I wonder, maybe Dick... So he was in the room with Mr. Wentworth. I don't know, but I'll make him tell. Don't say a word about the coin trick.

I don't! I have to make, like, a concerted effort to look at them. We all do. It's depressing. We only need phase four women as mother figures. As, like, therapists and mentors.

He's just returned from being out in the middle of nowhere with Hector, and he saw
the muse that he needed in his life but he had to leave her behind so he essentially has this fever dream in which he relives the experience and goes back into the middle of the wilderness and finds her and brings her back and when we watched this in post-production we realized that
it actually made more sense that he almost conjured her with his artwork, rather than having to physically retrieve her. So we recut this, and I think the end result in the film is actually much more effective. But there are some cool shots in here, so I thought we'd show them to you guys.
The next scene is from the end of the film after...
Our Maria character has witnessed the death of her ex-boyfriend, Jason. We had a couple of these quiet moments with Maria, which I love because Kate just knocked it out of the park with her performance. Again, it was an issue of sort of streamlining the ending. We sort of feel like the momentum is leading us towards the big showdown here, so we couldn't spend too much time with her. But...
I love the looks that she gives. I love that there's my college sweater over there on her couch, which I thought was kind of cool. And she's sort of recovering from trauma and she has this dirty laundry everywhere because she hasn't gotten out of the house in weeks.
And so it sort of establishes what she's doing when the Muse character later appears in her apartment, which is she's finally trying to clean up her place and getting her life back in order.",False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False

Dixon follows behind it on his longboard as the Mercedes comes to a stop at a crowded intersection. When the smoke clears, we see a New York police officer shouting at the driver to pull over.
But instead of obeying, the man behind the wheel does the unthinkable. He steps on the gas and the policeman rolls across the hood of the car and then slams down hard on the pavement.
The attempted traffic stop turns into a foot chase, as officers and Dixon do their best to keep up with the Mercedes. The Mercedes speeds up 42nd Street, plowing past pedestrians and through heavy traffic. It's a mad dash to keep up with the car and stop the driver from not only getting away, but doing more damage.
The officers sprint up the street, shouting to police up ahead to stop the Mercedes. Get that car! Get the car! The streets are packed with cars, cops, and bystanders. Yet, unbelievably, the Mercedes is able to plow its way through. Oh, my son just swiped, swiped all these cars. That **** is gone!

No, there's one thing, actually, in particular that I'll remember till the day that I die. Yeah, it's back in 91, just before my unit was flown out to Kuwait to mop up the last pockets of resistance. Me and this young fella called Eddie Oswald decided to go and get a tattoo done to commemorate our first trip into the desert. I remember, Eddie. He was a stocky hard case with a broken nose and a bong eye, yeah? Yeah, that's him. Good looking fella. Big hit with the ladies.
Anyway, me and Eddie, we went and had a few drinks. We had a lot of drinks. And we went down to the tattoo parlour and I got a desert rat done. And Eddie being Eddie, he wanted something with a bit more meaning. And being a bit of a believer, he said that his soul still belonged to God. But his flesh, well, his flesh was way beyond redemption. And it was up to Satan to save his skin. So he got this fucking great laughing devil tattooed right on his arse.
Anyway, about six days later, we were making a regular sweep along the Iraqi border. And Eddie, bullfucker, triggered an anti-tank mine. Yeah, we all saw it happen. I mean, he was on point. White, blinding lightning flash and a fucking deafening crack. And by the time we picked ourselves up off the deck, Eddie was... He was gone. Just bits and pieces of him.
It's all that remained, this big fucking red circle, 100 metres. I'll tell you something, lads, it really puts things in perspective when you have to scoop your mate up with a shovel and stick him in a bin bag. Anyway, the thing that really did our nuts in that day was when you came across the bit you recognised. Bit of the toe and nose, the tooth.
The thing that really freaked us out that day was when left-hand Charlie found a bit of Eddie with a tattoo on. I mean, everything else was burnt to a crisp, covered in carrot, all mushed up, poked up. Not this bit. This bit was perfect. And there's old Nick, chalking his fucking arsehole off at us.

Or you could say that Eddie was just unlucky. Either way, it taught me to keep a very open mind. Boom, boom. Anyway, Eddie Oswald.
