Yeah, looks like it. Good evening. May I speak to the director, please?\\nVisitors? Why, the Reverend would be overjoyed. You almost never have visitors. Come in, please.\\nWho is it? Visitors, Reverend. Visitors at this hour of the night. Excuse us for disturbing you, Reverend. My name is Holt, Inspector Holt of Scotland Yard. This is Miss Ward and my assistant, Sergeant Harvey. Scotland Yard? Yes, Reverend. We're looking for a blind peddler in connection with a murder case. Oh, I hope it's not one of my pensioners. When I assumed direction here, it was known as a hiding place for shady characters. But I believe I have succeeded in my efforts to improve it. I, uh...\\nI'm looking for a certain Jacob Farrell, known as Blind Jack. Do you know him? I'm sorry to say that name is completely unfamiliar. Our pensioners are all investigated before being admitted. In our records, however, this is the last address we have. I used to know Blind Jack, Reverend. Is that you, Norris? Yes. Tell the police everything you know. Well, Blind Jack used to live here before the Reverend came.\\nDo you know where he is now? He hasn't been around here for a long while. What is it? What's the matter? Here. A braille message. One of the blind men may have put it in here, sir. Can you decipher it? Yes.\\nThe whole town is threatened by the blind killer. And Blind Jack sometimes comes here night. The Reverend knows nothing. One of the blind men has the information we want, but he's afraid to speak. Yes, but which of them? There were more than two dozen. We must find him and speak to him alone when he has nothing to fear. Maybe we might be able to learn something from the janitor. He can see. Perhaps he may help us. Nora? Yes? I have a better idea. You observe what's going on in there.\\nYou must see the Reverend and pretend you want to be of assistance to him in his work for the blind, or something like that. Yes, I understand. Would you do that for me? For you, yes. For Scotland Yard, perhaps. Thank you. There, I'll sign the correspondence afterwards. I'll draw by a bit later tonight. There's a man waiting outside, Mr. Gordon Stewart from Canada. He wishes to speak to you personally about an insurance policy. All right, show him in.\\nCome in, Mr. Stewart. Thank you. How do you do, Mr. Stewart? Won't you sit down, please? Hello? It's me, Edgar. Sir, the deal's off. He's coming back here tonight.\\nHis car's parked in the parking place. A light Mercedes with a black top. You can't miss it. License plate D-U-L-A-4-5. I'll look for it.

That same year, Chase also co-wrote Florida Georgia Lions' massive hit single, Cruise. The following year, he released Ready, Set, Roll, a seven track EP, which finally proved his value as it hit number two on the Independent Albums chart, four on the Top Country Albums chart, 16 in the Billboard 200,  and had its single ready set role hit the number five position on both the Hot Country Songs and Country Airplay charts.

That same year, Chase also co-wrote Florida Georgia Lions' massive hit single, Cruise. The following year, he released Ready, Set, Roll, a seven track EP, which finally proved his value as it hit number two on the Independent Albums chart, four on the Top Country Albums chart, 16 in the Billboard 200,  and had its single ready set role hit the number five position on both the Hot Country Songs and Country Airplay charts. Keith, however, proved to be amongst the best in country music yet again when his new album, Fuse, topped the Billboard 200 that year, while also becoming his fourth album to reach number one in the Top Country Albums chart.

Yeah, looks like it. Good evening. May I speak to the director, please?\\nVisitors? Why, the Reverend would be overjoyed. You almost never have visitors. Come in, please.\\nWho is it? Visitors, Reverend. Visitors at this hour of the night. Excuse us for disturbing you, Reverend. My name is Holt, Inspector Holt of Scotland Yard. This is Miss Ward and my assistant, Sergeant Harvey. Scotland Yard? Yes, Reverend. We're looking for a blind peddler in connection with a murder case. Oh, I hope it's not one of my pensioners. When I assumed direction here, it was known as a hiding place for shady characters. But I believe I have succeeded in my efforts to improve it. I, uh...\\nI'm looking for a certain Jacob Farrell, known as Blind Jack. Do you know him? I'm sorry to say that name is completely unfamiliar. Our pensioners are all investigated before being admitted. In our records, however, this is the last address we have. I used to know Blind Jack, Reverend. Is that you, Norris? Yes. Tell the police everything you know. Well, Blind Jack used to live here before the Reverend came.\\nDo you know where he is now? He hasn't been around here for a long while. What is it? What's the matter? Here. A braille message. One of the blind men may have put it in here, sir. Can you decipher it? Yes.\\nThe whole town is threatened by the blind killer. And Blind Jack sometimes comes here night. The Reverend knows nothing. One of the blind men has the information we want, but he's afraid to speak. Yes, but which of them? There were more than two dozen. We must find him and speak to him alone when he has nothing to fear. Maybe we might be able to learn something from the janitor. He can see. Perhaps he may help us. Nora? Yes? I have a better idea. You observe what's going on in there.\\nYou must see the Reverend and pretend you want to be of assistance to him in his work for the blind, or something like that. Yes, I understand. Would you do that for me? For you, yes. For Scotland Yard, perhaps. Thank you. There, I'll sign the correspondence afterwards. I'll draw by a bit later tonight. There's a man waiting outside, Mr. Gordon Stewart from Canada. He wishes to speak to you personally about an insurance policy. All right, show him in.\\nCome in, Mr. Stewart. Thank you. How do you do, Mr. Stewart? Won't you sit down, please? Hello? It's me, Edgar. Sir, the deal's off. He's coming back here tonight.\\nHis car's parked in the parking place. A light Mercedes with a black top. You can't miss it. License plate D-U-L-A-4-5. I'll look for it.
